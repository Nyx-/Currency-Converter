# Currency-Converter

The Currency Converter will enable user to convert currency between two selected countries.
The list of countries include Australia, China, Denmark, Europe, India, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America and Vietnam. 

We are assuming fixed exchange rates between Australia and the other nine countries. In addition we are assuming that the cross exchange rates are based on these fixed exchange rates.
For example, to exchange United States dollars (USD) to Chinese Yuan (CYN), one first converts the USD to AUD and then converts the AUD to CYN.
